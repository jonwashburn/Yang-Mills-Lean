## Impact

The reduction from 34 to 9 sorries represents a 73.5% completion rate. The remaining sorries are primarily in TransferMatrix.lean and involve:
- Advanced mathematical analysis (Hilbert-Schmidt operators, spectral theory)
- Measure theory (path integral normalization)
- Combinatorial counting (lattice sites in 3D)

These remaining proofs require deeper mathematical machinery from mathlib or additional axiomatization of the physical principles.
