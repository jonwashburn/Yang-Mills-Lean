# Mathlib Completion Summary

## Overview
We've made significant progress in completing the Yang-Mills proof by using Mathlib lemmas where possible and properly structuring the proof to minimize axioms.

## Completed Using Mathlib

1. **Jordan's Inequality (`cos_bound` in Wilson/LedgerBridge.lean)**
   - Used `Real.mul_abs_le_abs_sin` from Mathlib
   - Proves the key bound: `1 - cos θ ≥ (2/π²) * θ²`

2. **Parameter Infrastructure**
   - Created `Parameters/Constants.lean` - declares parameters as constants
   - Created `Parameters/Assumptions.lean` - contains parameter axioms
   - Eliminated duplicate axiom declarations

3. **Basic Definitions**
   - Created `GaugeLayer.lean` with vacuum state definition
   - Created `TransferMatrix.lean` to re-export and define `IsYangMillsMassGap`
   - Added missing definitions for reflection positivity

## Current Status

### Files Without Sorries ✅
- Parameters/Constants.lean
- Parameters/Assumptions.lean  
- TransferMatrix.lean

### Remaining Sorries (58 total)
- Wilson/LedgerBridge.lean: 7 sorries
- Measure/ReflectionPositivity.lean: 15 sorries
- RG/ContinuumLimit.lean: 17 sorries
- Topology/ChernWhitney.lean: 10 sorries
- RG/StepScaling.lean: 8 sorries
- Complete.lean: 1 sorry

### Axioms
The only axioms remaining are the parameter assumptions in `Parameters/Assumptions.lean`:
- Golden ratio properties (φ > 1, φ² = φ + 1)
- Positivity of physical parameters
- Specific numerical values (to be derived later)

## Key Remaining Work

### 1. Group Theory (Wilson/LedgerBridge.lean)
- `centre_angle_bound`: Requires SU(3) group theory
- Plaquette angle bounds
- Centre projection properties

### 2. Measure Theory (Measure/ReflectionPositivity.lean)
- Factorization of measures
- Thermodynamic limit
- Could potentially use more Mathlib measure theory

### 3. Analysis (RG/ContinuumLimit.lean)
- Cauchy sequence convergence
- Scaling limits
- Could use Mathlib's metric space theory

### 4. Topology (Topology/ChernWhitney.lean)
- Künneth formula application
- Cohomology computations
- Would need Mathlib's algebraic topology (if available)

### 5. ODE Theory (RG/StepScaling.lean)
- RG flow equations
- Could potentially use Mathlib's ODE theory (Gronwall lemma imported but not used)

### 6. Numerical Computation (Complete.lean)
- Final sorry requires bounds on `Real.sqrt 5`
- Could potentially be completed with Mathlib's numerical approximation lemmas

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate completions possible with Mathlib:**
   - Cauchy-Schwarz in ReflectionPositivity.lean
   - Basic convergence proofs in ContinuumLimit.lean
   - Numerical approximation in Complete.lean

2. **Require domain-specific proofs:**
   - SU(3) group theory results
   - Lattice gauge theory specifics
   - Recognition Science ledger model properties

3. **Future work:**
   - Derive parameter values from first principles
   - Complete topological computations
   - Prove thermodynamic limit rigorously

The proof structure is now clean with proper separation of parameters, clear dependencies, and all axioms isolated in one file. The remaining sorries are well-documented with explanations of what's needed to complete them.
