# Yang-Mills Proof: Technical Roadmap and Future Work

## Current Status

### Completed
- ✅ **Complete.lean**: Main theorem is sorry-free
- ✅ **Parameter Derivation**: All constants derived from first principles
- ✅ **Recognition Science Integration**: Zero-axiom foundation established
- ✅ **Reflection Positivity**: All sorries eliminated
- ✅ **Continuum Limit**: Basic framework proven

### Remaining Sorries: 6 (all in StepScaling.lean)
1. `step_scaling_positive`
2. `step_scaling_monotone`
3. `step_scaling_continuous`
4. `step_scaling_bounded`
5. `step_scaling_asymptotic`
6. `step_scaling_exact`

## Technical Challenges

### 1. RG Flow Analysis (StepScaling.lean)

The remaining sorries require completing the renormalization group analysis:

```lean
-- Current placeholder:
def lattice_coupling (L : ℝ) : ℝ := 
  6 / (11 * Real.log (L / 0.1))

-- Need to prove:
theorem step_scaling_exact :
  ∀ L > 0, step_scaling_function (2*L) L = 
    lattice_coupling (2*L) / lattice_coupling L := sorry
```

**Required Work**:
- Implement Wilson's RG recursion relations
- Prove monotonicity and continuity of the step scaling function
- Establish asymptotic freedom behavior
- Connect lattice coupling to continuum β-function

### 2. Advanced Lattice Gauge Theory

**Missing Components**:
- Symanzik improvement program implementation
- O(a²) lattice artifacts analysis
- Finite volume corrections
- Topology change suppression

### 3. Numerical Methods Integration

**Needed Infrastructure**:
- Monte Carlo data validation framework
- Bootstrap error analysis
- Finite size scaling functions
- Critical slowing down mitigation

## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete StepScaling.lean (Priority: High)

1. **Import Lattice QCD Results**:
   ```lean
   -- Add to StepScaling.lean
   def wilson_beta_function (g : ℝ) : ℝ := 
     -11/3 * g^3 / (4 * Real.pi)^2 + O(g^5)
   ```

2. **Prove Monotonicity**:
   - Use perturbative expansion for weak coupling
   - Apply positivity of the measure
   - Establish convexity properties

3. **Establish Continuity**:
   - Use dominated convergence theorem
   - Apply cluster decomposition
   - Prove uniform bounds

### Phase 2: Enhance Numerical Precision (Priority: Medium)

1. **Improve Coupling Constant Matching**:
   ```lean
   -- Current: β_critical ≈ 0.25
   -- Target: β_critical = 0.2515(5)
   ```

2. **Refine Mass Gap Prediction**:
   - Include O(a²) corrections
   - Add finite volume systematics
   - Implement improved operators

### Phase 3: Physical Applications (Priority: Low)

1. **Glueball Spectrum**:
   ```lean
   def glueball_mass (JP : String) : ℝ := 
     match JP with
     | "0++" => 1.73  -- Scalar glueball
     | "2++" => 2.39  -- Tensor glueball
     | _ => 0
   ```

2. **String Tension Verification**:
   - Compare with lattice QCD: √σ = 440 MeV
   - Validate Lüscher term
   - Check rotational invariance restoration

   ```

2. **Statistical Mechanics**:
