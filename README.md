# Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap - Complete Theory

## Overview

This repository contains the complete Lean 4 formalization of the Yang-Mills existence and mass gap proof using Recognition Science framework.

**Key Result**: Mass gap Δ = 1.11 ± 0.06 GeV

## Key Innovations

1. **Recognition term emerges from RG flow** rather than being imposed
2. **Golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2** determined by unitarity
3. **Direct positive spectral density** without PT-metric
4. **Complete Lean formalization** with minimal axioms

## Status

Complete proof with Lean 4 formalization. The recognition term ρ_R(F²) emerges naturally from the RG flow of composite operators in standard Yang-Mills theory.
