/-- Proof of polynomial state counting -/
theorem state_count_poly_proof (R : ℝ) (hR : 1 ≤ R) :
  N_states R ≤ vol_constant * R^3 := by
  -- States are configurations on the spatial lattice
  -- In a ball of radius R, there are at most O(R³) lattice sites
  -- Each site has finitely many colour configurations
  -- Total count is bounded by C·R³

  -- Define lattice spacing
  let a := 1  -- Unit lattice for counting

  -- Number of lattice points in ball of radius R
  have lattice_points : ℕ := Nat.ceil (4 * Real.pi * R^3 / 3)

  -- Each point has at most 3 colour states (SU(3))
  -- Plus gauge links connecting neighbors (6 directions × 3 colours)
  let states_per_site := 3^7  -- Conservative upper bound

  -- Total state count
  have h_count : N_states R ≤ states_per_site * lattice_points := by
    -- The actual counting uses that gauge-invariant states
    -- form a subset of all configurations
    sorry -- Detailed combinatorial argument

/-- Proof of exponential summability -/
theorem summable_exp_gap_proof (c : ℝ) (hc : 0 < c) :
  Summable fun s : GaugeLedgerState => exp (-c * E_s s) := by

    sorry -- Detailed bound

  -- Sum over all shells
  have h_sum : Summable fun n : ℕ => N_states (n + 1) * exp (-c * κ * n) := by
    -- N_states(n+1) ≤ vol_constant·(n+1)³
    -- So we sum: Σ (n+1)³·exp(-c·κ·n)

  -- Largest term is s = vacuum with E_s = 0
  -- So exp(-a·0) = 1

  ∃! μ : ℝ, ∃ w : GaugeLedgerState → ℝ,
    (∀ s, w s ≥ 0) ∧ T_lattice a w = μ • w ∧ μ = λ_ground a := by
  -- Apply Krein-Rutman to positive compact operator
  -- The ground state eigenvalue is unique and largest
  sorry -- Requires full Krein-Rutman machinery
