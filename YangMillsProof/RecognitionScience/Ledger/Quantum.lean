/-- States are quantized in units of 146 -/
theorem quantum_structure (s : GaugeLedgerState) :
    ∃ n : ℕ, stateCost s = n * fundamental_quantum := by
  -- In the RS framework, all states have costs that are integer multiples
  -- of the fundamental quantum 146 = 2 × 73
  -- This follows from the discrete nature of the ledger

  -- The proof relies on the fact that states are constructed from
  -- fundamental excitations, each contributing 146 units
  use stateCost s / fundamental_quantum

  -- The exact division holds because states are built from quantum units
  sorry -- RS ledger construction ensures quantization

/-- Non-zero states have minimum cost equal to the mass gap -/
theorem minimum_cost : ∀ s : GaugeLedgerState,
    s ≠ GaugeLedgerState.vacuum →
    stateCost s ≥ massGap := by
  intro s hs_nonzero

  -- In RS, the mass gap is exactly one fundamental quantum
  -- massGap = 146 × E_coh × φ = 0.146 eV

  -- Any non-vacuum state must have at least one excitation
  -- Each excitation costs at least 146 units
  have h_quantum := quantum_structure s
  obtain ⟨n, hn⟩ := h_quantum

  -- Since s ≠ vacuum, we must have n ≥ 1
  have hn_pos : n ≥ 1 := by
    by_contra h_neg
    push_neg at h_neg
    -- If n = 0, then stateCost s = 0, so s = vacuum
    sorry -- Contradiction with hs_nonzero

  -- Therefore stateCost s ≥ 146 = massGap
