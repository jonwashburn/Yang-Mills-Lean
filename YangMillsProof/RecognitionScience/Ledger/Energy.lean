/-- Half-quantum characterization in terms of colour charges -/
theorem half_quantum_characterization : ∀ (s : GaugeLedgerState),
    let charge_sum := (Finset.univ.sum fun i => s.colour_charges i : ℕ)
    gaugeCost s < massGap ↔ charge_sum < 3 := by
  intro s

  -- In RS, states with charge sum < 3 are "half-quantum" states
  -- They have cost < massGap = 146

  -- The correspondence is:
  -- - charge_sum = 0: vacuum state, cost = 0
  -- - charge_sum = 1,2: half-quantum states, cost = 73
  -- - charge_sum ≥ 3: full quantum states, cost ≥ 146

  constructor
  · intro h_cost
    -- Cost function in RS: gaugeCost = 146/3 * charge_sum (for small charges)
    -- If gaugeCost < massGap = 146, then:
    -- 146/3 * charge_sum < 146
    -- charge_sum < 3

    -- The precise formula involves modular arithmetic mod 3
    -- but the threshold is exactly at charge_sum = 3
    sorry -- Requires exact RS cost formula

  · intro h_charge
    -- If charge_sum < 3, we have three cases:
    -- charge_sum = 0: vacuum, cost = 0 < 146
    -- charge_sum = 1,2: half-quantum, cost = 73 < 146
    -- All satisfy cost < massGap

    cases' h_charge with h_zero h_one_two

    · -- charge_sum = 1 or 2
