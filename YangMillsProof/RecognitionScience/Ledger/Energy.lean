/-- Minimal physical excitation has single colour charge -/
theorem minimal_physical_excitation (s : GaugeLedgerState) :
    (∀ t : GaugeLedgerState, t ≠ GaugeLedgerState.vacuum → stateCost t ≥ stateCost s) →
    s ≠ GaugeLedgerState.vacuum →
    s.colour_charges.support.card = 1 := by
  intro h_minimal h_nonvacuum

  -- The minimal non-vacuum state has exactly one colour charge
  -- This follows from the RS principle that excitations are localized

  -- By contradiction, suppose it has 0 or ≥2 charges
  by_contra h_not_one

  -- If card = 0, then s is vacuum
  -- If card ≥ 2, we can construct a cheaper state with card = 1
  sorry -- RS localization principle

/-- Half-quantum characterization in terms of colour charges -/
theorem half_quantum_characterization : ∀ (s : GaugeLedgerState),
    let charge_sum := (Finset.univ.sum fun i => s.colour_charges i : ℕ)
    gaugeCost s < massGap ↔ charge_sum < 3 := by
  intro s

  -- In RS, states with charge sum < 3 are "half-quantum" states
  -- They have cost < massGap = 146

  -- The correspondence is:
  -- - charge_sum = 0: vacuum state, cost = 0
  -- - charge_sum = 1,2: half-quantum states, cost = 73
  -- - charge_sum ≥ 3: full quantum states, cost ≥ 146

  constructor
  · intro h_cost
    -- If cost < massGap, must be vacuum or half-quantum
    -- These have charge_sum < 3
    sorry -- RS charge-cost correspondence

  · intro h_charge
    -- If charge_sum < 3, state is vacuum or half-quantum
    -- These have cost < massGap
    sorry -- RS charge-cost correspondence
