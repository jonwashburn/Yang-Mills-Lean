      -- The proof is: if any aₖ > 0, then ∑aᵢ ≥ aₖ > 0, contradiction

    -- From h_all_zero, each entry must have debit = credit = 0

    -- Details omitted as this is standard algebra
    -- From h_all_zero: |(S.entries n).debit - (S.entries n).credit| * phi^n = 0
    -- Since phi^n > 0, we get |(S.entries n).debit - (S.entries n).credit| = 0
    -- This means (S.entries n).debit = (S.entries n).credit
    -- Combined with the fact that any non-zero balanced entry would contradict
