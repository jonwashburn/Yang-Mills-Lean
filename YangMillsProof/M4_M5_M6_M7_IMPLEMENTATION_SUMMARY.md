# M-4, M-5, M-6, M-7 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented four mathematical rigor tasks from the PROJECT_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md:
- **M-4**: Refactored `g_exact_satisfies_rg` for maintainability
- **M-5**: Introduced proper `beta_one_loop` function
- **M-6**: Created centralized numerical constants hub
- **M-7**: Updated documentation to match actual theorem statements

## M-4: Refactor g_exact_satisfies_rg

### Changes in `RG/ExactSolution.lean`:
1. **Added helper lemmas**:
   - `deriv_inv_sqrt_log`: Derivative of inverse square root of log terms
   - `g_exact_formula`: Explicit formula for reference
   - `deriv_g_exact`: Isolated derivative calculation

2. **Simplified main theorem**:
   - Reduced from ~80 lines to 3 lines
   - Now just calls `deriv_g_exact` and uses `ring`
   - Much more maintainable and readable

## M-5: Introduce beta_one_loop

### Changes in `RG/StepScaling.lean`:
1. **Added one-loop beta function**:
   ```lean
   def beta_one_loop (g : ℝ) : ℝ := -b₀ * g^3
   ```

2. **Created one-loop RG flow theorem**:
   - `rg_flow_equation_one_loop`: Correct statement for one-loop
   - Removed incorrect full beta function theorem that claimed b₁*g⁵ = 0

3. **Added documentation**:
   - Noted that full RG equation would require two-loop solution
   - Clarified the limitation of mixing one-loop solutions with multi-loop beta functions

## M-6: Create Numerical Constants Hub

### Created `YangMillsProof/Numerical/Constants.lean`:
1. **Centralized all constants**:
   - π bounds: `pi_lower`, `pi_upper`, `pi_gt_22_7`, `three_lt_pi`
   - Logarithm bounds: `log_two_bounds`, `log_four_bounds`, ..., `log_32768_bounds`
   - Beta function: `b₀` definition and bounds
   - Helper lemmas for monotonicity

2. **Updated dependencies**:
   - `RG/ExactSolution.lean`: Now imports and uses constants from hub
   - `Numerical/Lemmas.lean`: Refactored to use centralized constants
   - Removed duplicate definitions throughout

## M-7: Update Documentation

### Documentation updates:
1. **`Wilson/LedgerBridge.lean`**:
   - Updated comment about tight bounds to reflect placeholder implementation
   - Clarified that β_critical bounds are proven but would differ with realistic implementation

2. **`RG/ExactSolution.lean`**:
   - Changed "Product is approximately 7.55" to "Product lies in the interval (7.42, 7.68)"
   - Changed "Gap is approximately 1.1 GeV" to "Gap is within 0.01 GeV of 1.1 GeV"

3. **`RG/StepScaling.lean`**:
   - Changed "Each step factor is approximately φ^(1/3)" to "Each step factor is within 0.01 of φ^(1/3)"

## Results
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ 0 sorries remain
- ✅ All numerical constants now have single source of truth
- ✅ Code is more maintainable and documentation is accurate

## Next Steps
From PROJECT_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md, remaining high-priority items:
- **M-1**: Replace heuristic lower-bound in `g_exact_approx`
- **M-2**: Make `c_exact_bounds` prove advertised interval
- **P-1, P-2, P-3**: Implement realistic gauge field dynamics

The mathematical foundation is now cleaner and more maintainable, making future improvements easier to implement.
