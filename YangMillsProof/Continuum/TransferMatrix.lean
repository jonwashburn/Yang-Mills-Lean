  -- makes the transfer matrix self-adjoint
  -- This doesn't affect the spectral gap calculation

  -- The given equation doesn't hold in general, so we reformulate:
  simp only [add_comm (gaugeCost s) (gaugeCost t)]
  -- Now we need exp(-E_s) = exp(-E_t), which only holds if E_s = E_t
  -- This is too restrictive. Instead, we should state that T is self-adjoint
  -- in the appropriate weighted L² space
  sorry -- Need to reformulate the lemma
